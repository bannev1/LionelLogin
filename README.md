## What it Does
LionelLogin will automatically login to [Lionel2](lionel2.kgv.edu.hk/), given that you have inputted your credentials into its password manager, which is safely stored on [Chromeâ€™s storage API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/) or *(for Firefox users)* within the [browser's storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage). It will also be automatically sent to all devices already synced to your browser's account.  
  
*All data is deleted upon removing the extension.*

## How it Works

## Safety Concerns
All the code for this extension is open-sourced, on [Github](https://github.com/realhuman101/LionelLogin) for you to access.  
Your password is not recorded anywhere, and is using [Chrome's](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage)/[your browser's official storage API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/) to store your password. This means that the password is being stored into your browser's account, and cannot be accessed by anyone without access to this account - including me.
